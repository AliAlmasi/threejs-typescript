# Three.js with Typescript [@dansalahi](https://github.com/dansalahi)
## Installing dependencies
You can install the project's dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory.

This will read the _package.json_ file and install all the required dependencies for the project.
## Running the Development Server
To start the development server, use `yarn run dev` command.

This command will start the development server and compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript, enabling you to view and interact with your Three.js application in a local development environment.

Make sure to keep the terminal or command prompt open while you're working on your project. You can access your application by opening a web browser and visiting the provided URL, usually `http://localhost:8080` or another port specified in the configuration.
